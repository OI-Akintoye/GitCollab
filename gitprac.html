    <h1>What is GPU Processing?</h1>
    <p>GPU processing is the use of GPU cores to do computational tasks, enabling <em>parallel processing.</em>Some examples of GPU suited problems include mathematical problems. Read more about the more problems at<a href = "https://www.techtarget.com/searchvirtualdesktop/definition/GPU-graphics-processing-unit"> this website.</a></p>
    <p class = "class">What actually goes into the buildiing of a GPU?</p>
    <p class = "class">A GPU is made up of a large amount of transistors, that are used in together to make a large amount of boolean expressions. Other materials within the GPU are cobalt, nickel and tungsten</p>
