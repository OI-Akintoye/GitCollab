    <h1>Remote communication</h1>
    <h2>Emails</h2>
    <p>Before computers existed as we know them today, humans could only communicate with each other remotely by methods like letters. It could take weeks to receive and send a response, which isn't very convenient. When e-mails were first introduced to the world, they revolutionsed communcations, particularly for businesses as it is most often with new technological advancements. The price of a computer decreased year after year and eventually became afordable for the everyday person. Sending emails was much more quicker than sending letters, receveing them in a matter of minutes then and now almost instantenously.</p>
    <h2>Social Media</h2>
    <p>As the 2000s rolled around, tech companies started to experiment with platforms called social media. For example, Facebook was formed in the mid-2000s and has grown to be one of the biggest social media platforms, amounting to over a billion users. It allows people to send to each other friend requests and private messages, publish posts which can be seen by a range of people, which can be chosen by the user posting, among many other things.</p>
    <p>It was the only one like it at the time. This excludes blogs, which do allow for comments to be posted but are not as centralised and easy to connect with others as Facebook or Instagram.</p>
