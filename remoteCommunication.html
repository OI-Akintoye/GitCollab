    <h1>Remote communication</h1>

    <h2>Emails</h2>
    <div id="Subsection-block">
        <p>Before computers existed as we know them today, humans could only communicate with each other remotely by methods like letters. It could take weeks to receive and send a response, which isn't very convenient. When e-mails were first introduced to the world, they revolutionsed communcations, particularly for businesses as it is most often with new technological advancements. The price of a computer decreased year after year and eventually became afordable for the everyday person. Sending emails was much more quicker than sending letters, receveing them in a matter of minutes then and now almost instantenously.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Text Messages</h2>
    <div id="Subsection-block">
        <p>This became an increasingly popular method of communicating as mobile phones increased in popularity throughout the 2000s due to convenience but also depiction in the wider media, including TV shows.</p>
        <p>Texting does not require any internet access but instead requires satelite reception, which is easier to obtain than wireless internet. It is much easier to carry a small device than a computer, which makes texting much more convenient than sending emails.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Social Media</h2>
    <div id="Subsection-block">
        <p>As the 2000s rolled around, tech companies started to experiment with platforms called social media. For example, Facebook was formed in the mid-2000s and has grown to be one of the biggest social media platforms, amounting to over a billion users. It allows people to send to each other friend requests and private messages, publish posts which can be seen by a range of people, which can be chosen by the user posting, among many other things.</p>
        <p>It was the only one like it at the time. This excludes blogs, which do allow for comments to be posted but are not as centralised and easy to connect with others as Facebook or Instagram.</p>
        <p>Instagram was not created until about 2010, five years after Facebook. Both Facebook and Intagram are owned by the same parent company Meta, formerly known as Facebook. Other social media platforms were created throughout the early 2010s as businesses and consumers were eager to experience "this new big thing", though probably for different reasons.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Business Opportunities</h2>
    <div id="Subsection-block">
        <p>Automation of many business processes became possible with computers increasing in capabilities and, as a result, businesses were able to cut operating costs from employing people.</p>
        <p>This meant profits could be increased without putting the business itself at risk.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Wider Social Impact</h2>
    <div id="Subsection-block">
        <p>Being able to communicate remotely, show off your blog or business to anyone anywhere, and create whatever you want to achieve next has never been easier!</p>
